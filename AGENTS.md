# Agent Instructions

<!-- HARNESS:BEGIN -->
## Harness

Start with the requested outcome, then use the repository as the system of
record. Read `docs/WORKFLOW.md` and only the product, design, plan,
code, and validation material relevant to the task.

- Answers, explanations, reviews, diagnoses, plans, and status reports are
  read-only. Inspect only what is needed and do not mutate repository or Harness
  state.
- For a bounded change, use an ephemeral plan: inspect the affected behavior and
  existing proof, implement the change, and run behavior-appropriate validation.
  No Harness CLI operation is required.
- Create or update one file under `docs/plans/active/` when work spans sessions,
  needs coordination or an ordered sequence, has meaningful dependencies, or
  requires explicit recovery steps. Move it to `docs/plans/completed/` only
  after validation.
- Pause when product intent is ambiguous, an action is difficult to recover,
  validation would be weakened, or the request does not authorize the needed
  action.
- Claim completion only with relevant executable or observable evidence. Report
  the outcome, important changed surfaces, validation, and unresolved risks.

SQLite intake, story, trace, scoring, audit, and proposal commands are optional
compatibility features. Use them only when explicitly requested or required by
an external orchestrator.
